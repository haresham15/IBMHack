1. Executive Summary
Vantage is an AI-powered accessibility layer that sits 
on top of
 a university's existing infrastructure — translating the institution's complexity into a personalised, structured, and proactively managed experience for neurodivergent students. It requires zero replacement of existing university systems and is deployable within 90 days of a signed pilot agreement.
🎯  The Core Insight
Universities are not failing neurodivergent students academically — they are failing them administratively.
Vantage does not rebuild the university. It translates it.
1.1  The Crisis in Numbers
Statistic
Source
Only 58% of neurodivergent students graduate vs. 79% neurotypical peers
National Council on Disability, 2023
50% attrition rate for autistic college students specifically
Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders
50% of neurodivergent dropouts cite lack of accommodations as primary cause
AHEAD Disability Services Survey, 2022
1 in 5 college students is neurodivergent; many are undiagnosed
CDC / NCES, 2023
1 disability counselor per 700+ students on average
AHEAD National Survey of Disability Services, 2023
85% unemployment rate for autistic adults without a college degree
Autism Speaks Employment Report, 2023
These are not statistics about academic ability. Students who persist show 
comparable GPAs to neurotypical peers
. The dropout is driven entirely by systemic friction — dense PDFs, confusing portals, inaccessible processes, and a complete absence of proactive support. Vantage directly targets this friction.
2. Problem Statement
2.1  The Hidden Dropout
Universities have a graduation gap they cannot fully explain. When neurodivergent students drop out, the documented cause is rarely 'failed courses.' It is almost universally administrative collapse: a financial aid deadline lost in a 2005-era portal, a syllabus rubric that used ambiguous language the student could not decode, a housing form that required 14 sequential steps to complete under cognitive load. These are solvable problems that no one has solved because the solution requires crossing the boundary between AI capability and university bureaucracy.
2.2  Root Cause Analysis
Failure Point
How It Appears to the Student
Downstream Consequence
Neuro-rigid portals
Financial aid PDF buried 4 levels deep in a low-contrast UI
Student loses aid — drops out
Ambiguous syllabi
'Submit a substantial analysis' — no word count, no rubric clarity
Paralysis, incomplete submissions, failing grade
Passive support systems
Disability office requires student to initiate every interaction
Student with executive dysfunction never initiates — receives no help
Sensory-hostile environments
No data on quiet spaces, crowded routes, or low-stimulation windows
Student avoids campus — misses classes, office hours, social connection
Fragmented communication
Deadlines across email, LMS, department website, physical bulletin boards
Missed deadlines, accumulated anxiety, withdrawal
2.3  Why Existing Solutions Fail
Disability Services Offices: 
Understaffed (1:700 ratio), reactive not proactive, require the student to self-advocate at their most vulnerable.
LMS Platforms (Canvas, Blackboard): 
One-size-fits-all interfaces with no personalisation, no plain-language conversion, no executive function scaffolding.
Generic AI tools (ChatGPT, Notion AI): 
Not integrated with university systems. Require the student to initiate every interaction. No agentic action. Not designed for neurodivergent-specific needs.
University App Portals: 
Replicate the complexity of the original system in mobile form. Still require the student to navigate bureaucracy.
✅  The Vantage Difference
Vantage is the ONLY solution that: (1) integrates with real university systems, (2) acts proactively without requiring student initiation, (3) personalises output to a neurodivergent cognitive profile, and (4) is deployable in under 12 months without university IT rebuilds.
3. Product Overview
Vantage is structured around four deeply integrated pillars, each powered by specific IBM tools. Every pillar is independently deployable, allowing for a phased rollout, but they are designed to reinforce each other in the full product.
PILLAR 1 — The Cognitive Accessibility Profile (CAP) Engine
What it does
On first launch, Vantage guides the student through a natural-language onboarding conversation (not a clinical form). The conversation is powered by a WatsonX.ai Granite-3.x model and lasts approximately 4 minutes. It asks about information preferences, deadline anxiety, sensory sensitivities, and task management style. No clinical diagnosis is required or requested. The student is told: 'This helps Vantage communicate with you in the way that works best for your brain.'
What it produces
A Cognitive Accessibility Profile (CAP) — a structured JSON schema stored exclusively on IBM Cloud, linked only to an anonymised student ID. The CAP contains:
Information Density Preference: 
Summary-only / Moderate detail / Full detail
Time Horizon: 
How far ahead the student wants to be warned about deadlines (24h / 72h / 1 week / 2 weeks)
Sensory Flags: 
Loud spaces, fluorescent lighting, high foot traffic, open-plan environments
Executive Function Support Level: 
Reminder-only / Step-by-step guidance / Full agent-assisted task completion
Communication Channel: 
Push notification / SMS / Email / In-app only
Trusted Contact: 
Optional. A designated person (advisor, friend, parent) who receives a gentle nudge if the student disengages for a defined period
🔒  Privacy Architecture
The CAP is owned entirely by the student. No professor, advisor, or administrator can view it without the student explicitly sharing a sanitised summary.
The CAP is NOT medical data — it is self-reported preference data, analogous to a 'learning style profile.'
IBM OpenPages governs all data access policies. Student ID is anonymised at rest.
FERPA compliance: Vantage operates as a student-controlled tool. No institutional data is transmitted without student-initiated consent.
HIPAA note: CAP data is not classified as Protected Health Information (PHI) because no clinical diagnosis is stored. This has been architecturally enforced.
PILLAR 2 — The Translation Layer
What it does
Every piece of university communication — syllabi, financial aid letters, housing forms, policy documents, assignment rubrics — is automatically ingested, parsed, and rewritten by IBM Granite LLM according to the student's CAP. The student never has to interact with the original document unless they choose to. A 'View Original' button is always present.
Syllabus-to-Life Converter
When a syllabus PDF is uploaded (by the student, or auto-fetched from the LMS if integration exists), Granite:
Parses
 the full document, identifying all deadlines, assignments, rubrics, and attendance policies
Generates
 a colour-coded, prioritised weekly task calendar broken into daily micro-actions
Rewrites
 every assignment description in plain language calibrated to the student's CAP information density preference
Annotates
 every rubric with a plain-English explanation of what the professor actually wants
Creates
 a 'What does this mean?' explainer card for any ambiguous academic terminology
⚠️  Syllabus Parsing Limitations — Addressed
Syllabi come in hundreds of formats: scanned PDFs, embedded tables, informal prose, inconsistent date notation.
MVP Scope: Vantage's MVP demo uses 3 pre-tested real syllabi from the team's own university to ensure clean parsing.
Production Solution: A Granite prompt chain with a 'structured extraction' pass followed by a 'confidence scoring' pass. Low-confidence extractions are flagged for student review rather than presented as definitive.
The student always has access to the original document. Vantage never presents a translation as a replacement — only as a supplement.
Financial Aid & Admin Document Translation
For any university administrative document, Granite converts it into a numbered checklist in plain language, with each step written as a single clear action. A WatsonX Orchestrate agent then stands by to walk the student through each step in a conversational chat interface — including pre-filling form fields where API integration permits.
Integration Architecture for Document Ingestion
Document Source
MVP Approach
Phase 2 Approach
Syllabi
Manual PDF upload by student
Auto-fetch from Canvas/Blackboard LMS via REST API
Financial Aid Notices
Student forwards email or uploads PDF
IBM App Connect integration with Student Information System (Banner/PeopleSoft)
Housing Forms
Manual upload or URL paste
Direct API connection to housing portal
Course Deadlines
Extracted from syllabi at upload time
Real-time LMS calendar API sync
⚠️  ERP Integration Reality Check — Addressed
Banner, PeopleSoft, and Workday are notoriously closed systems. Full API integration is NOT a hackathon weekend task.
MVP clearly scopes ERP integration as Phase 2.
IBM App Connect is named as the integration middleware for Phase 2, demonstrating architectural awareness.
The MVP demo uses a mock CSV data feed to simulate real-time deadline data — this is clearly labelled as a simulation in the demo.
PILLAR 3 — The Proactive Agent
What it does
This is the most differentiating feature of Vantage. WatsonX Orchestrate monitors student engagement with their task list, deadline proximity, and document interaction history. When risk signals appear, the agent does not wait for the student to ask for help. It initiates.
Risk Signal Detection
Risk Signal
Threshold
Agent Action
Task list not opened
72 hours of inactivity
Gentle in-app prompt: 'You have 3 tasks this week — want a quick 2-min review?'
Critical deadline approaching
Within student's CAP time horizon
Plain-language alert + offer to open guided form walk-through
Required document not opened
Financial aid form within 5 days of deadline
'I noticed you haven't opened your FAFSA form. Want to do it together right now? ~8 min.'
Prolonged disengagement
7+ days of no activity (configurable)
Gentle nudge to student's designated Trusted Contact (only if pre-authorised by student)
Agent-Assisted Form Completion
When a student accepts the agent's offer to complete a form together, WatsonX Orchestrate:
Step 1: 
Renders the form as a conversational chat sequence — one question at a time, in plain language
Step 2: 
Pre-populates any fields it can from already-known student data (with student permission)
Step 3: 
Saves progress automatically, so the student can pause and resume without losing work
Step 4: 
Submits the completed form to the university portal via API, or exports a completed PDF if direct API access is unavailable (MVP: PDF export)
🔒  Trusted Contact — Privacy & Consent Architecture
The Trusted Contact feature is 100% opt-in. Students designate their contact at setup and can remove or change it at any time.
The nudge sent to the Trusted Contact contains ZERO academic or medical information. It reads only: 'Vantage noticed [Name] may benefit from a check-in this week.'
No contact is ever notified without student pre-authorisation. The feature defaults to OFF.
PILLAR 4 — The Sensory Campus Map
What it does
Using real-time occupancy and scheduling data that universities already collect, Vantage builds a live sensory map of campus — helping neurodivergent students navigate, study, and plan in ways that minimise sensory overload.
Data Sources (Real, Not Synthetic)
Campus Wi-Fi density feeds: 
Universities track device counts per access point for network management. This data is available internally and does not require new infrastructure.
Classroom scheduling APIs: 
Room booking systems (25Live, EMS) expose occupancy schedules via API.
Student-contributed data: 
In-app 'quiet spot check-ins' allow students to mark locations as quiet/loud in real time, building a crowdsourced layer over the institutional data.
⚠️  Campus Data Access — Scoped Appropriately
Full real-time Wi-Fi integration requires a formal data-sharing agreement with university IT. This is NOT an MVP feature.
MVP approach: The sensory map is seeded from publicly available class schedules and student crowdsourced check-ins only.
Phase 2: IBM App Connect facilitates a controlled API connection to campus Wi-Fi occupancy data under a university data-sharing agreement.
This is explicitly labelled as Phase 2 in the deployment roadmap and in the demo.
Features
Quiet Route Navigation: 
Given a destination and departure time, Vantage suggests the least-crowded walking path based on class schedule and historical occupancy patterns
Low-Sensory Study Windows: 
'The 3rd floor of Dreese Labs is typically at 15% capacity between 2–4 PM on Tuesdays based on class schedules'
Safe Space Registry: 
Student-maintained map of designated sensory-friendly rooms, study carrels, and quiet lounges on campus
Pre-Trip Planner: 
Before a heavy campus day, Vantage generates a sensory-optimised schedule: which buildings to go to, in what order, with buffer time built in

5.2  Data Flow — Syllabus Translation
The following is the exact step-by-step data flow for the primary Syllabus-to-Life feature:
Step 1: 
Student uploads PDF via app → stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage (encrypted)
Step 2: 
Document Ingestion Service extracts raw text (using Apache Tika) and passes to WatsonX.ai
Step 3: 
Granite runs Extraction Pass — identifies assignments, deadlines, rubrics, policies with confidence scores
Step 4: 
Low-confidence extractions are flagged and queued for student confirmation
Step 5: 
Translation Pass — Granite rewrites all content according to the student's CAP (density, language level, time horizon)
Step 6: 
Task Calendar Service generates the prioritised to-do list and pushes to the student's dashboard
Step 7: 
WatsonX Orchestrate schedules proactive reminder agents based on extracted deadlines and CAP time horizon preference
Step 8: 
Original document remains accessible to student via 'View Original' link at all times

6. Deployment Roadmap (0–12 Months)
📋  Hackathon Requirement: Deployable at Scale in Under 12 Months
The following roadmap demonstrates a clear, credible, technically grounded path from MVP to multi-university deployment.
Each phase has a concrete deliverable, a go/no-go criterion, and a realistic IBM Cloud infrastructure requirement.
This is not aspirational. Each phase is scoped to what a 4-person team with IBM Cloud access can realistically execute.

0 — Hackathon MVP
Weekend
Working web app: CAP onboarding + Syllabus translation on 3 real syllabi + Proactive agent mock workflow + Demo video
Live Granite output demonstrated in video
1 — Pilot
Months 1–3
Recruit 50–100 neurodivergent students via campus Disability Services office. Deploy CAP engine + Translation Layer + Proactive Agent on IBM Cloud. Measure: task completion rate, deadline miss rate, student NPS.
25+ active students, positive NPS
2 — Integration
Months 4–6
IBM App Connect integration with Canvas LMS (calendar API). Financial aid deadline auto-import. Sensory Campus Map MVP using class schedule data + crowdsourced check-ins. Mobile app (React Native) launch.
LMS integration live, sensory map active
3 — Expand
Months 7–9
Federated multi-university deployment on IBM Cloud Kubernetes. Onboard 3–5 additional universities. Each gets isolated namespace. ERP integration (Banner/PeopleSoft) via App Connect for 2 pilot schools.
3+ universities live, retention data emerging
4 — Scale
Months 10–12
Publish retention outcome data from Phase 1 cohort. Target state university systems and community college networks. Full sensory map with Wi-Fi occupancy data at 2+ schools. Approach accreditation bodies about formal accommodation credit.
Measurable retention improvement vs. control cohort
💰  Business Case for Universities
Retaining one neurodivergent student generates $25,000–$60,000 in tuition revenue.
At 50 retained students per year, Vantage generates $1.25M–$3M in tuition recovery per institution.
Vantage can be offered at $15–25/student/month — a trivial cost vs. the tuition recovery ROI.
This also reduces Disability Services office caseload, freeing counselors for complex human-only work.

10. Known Limitations & Future Improvements
Acknowledging limitations honestly demonstrates maturity and builds judge trust. This section directly satisfies the 'Issues & Improvements' hackathon requirement.
Current Limitations (MVP)
Document format coverage: 
MVP supports clean PDFs and .docx syllabi. Scanned/image-based PDFs require OCR preprocessing — not yet implemented. Planned for Phase 1 using IBM Watson Document Understanding.
ERP integration: 
Financial aid and course data must be manually uploaded in MVP. IBM App Connect integration with Banner/PeopleSoft/Workday is Phase 2.
Sensory map data depth: 
MVP sensory map is seeded from class schedules and crowdsourced check-ins only. Real-time Wi-Fi occupancy integration requires campus IT data-sharing agreement — Phase 2.
Mobile app: 
MVP is web-only (React). Mobile app (React Native via Expo) is Phase 1 post-hackathon.
Multi-language support: 
MVP is English-only. Granite's multilingual capabilities enable this in Phase 2 for international students.
Co-design validation: 
Vantage has not yet been tested with a formal neurodivergent user cohort. This is the first priority of the Phase 1 pilot.
Planned Improvements
Watson Document Understanding: 
Full OCR pipeline for scanned PDFs, handwritten syllabi, and image-embedded text.
Accessibility audit tool: 
A feature that allows students to flag inaccessible university documents, automatically generating an accessibility report that can be (with student permission) forwarded to the Disability Services office.
Professor-facing layer: 
An opt-in tool where professors can upload syllabi and receive an 'accessibility score' plus plain-language rewrite suggestions — preventing inaccessibility at the source.
Peer support network: 
Anonymous matching of students with similar CAP profiles for peer study groups — IBM Granite used to suggest compatible study partners based on learning style, not just course overlap.
Outcome measurement dashboard: 
A university administrator view (anonymised, aggregated only) showing retention trend data for students using Vantage vs. a control cohort — building the evidence base for institutional adoption.
WHY VANTAGE WINS
#
Winning Criterion
Vantage's Answer
1
Undeniable problem
58% graduation rate. 50% dropout due to missing accommodations. These are not estimates — they are published, cited statistics.
2
Not just a chatbot
WatsonX Orchestrate acts without student initiation. It doesn't answer questions — it executes multi-step workflows across integrated systems.
3
IBM tools are structural
7 IBM tools, each powering a specific architectural component. Every tool name is traceable to an on-screen demo action.
4
Deployable, not theoretical
Zero university rebuilds required. 90-day MVP. 12-month multi-university scale on IBM Cloud Kubernetes. Credible, phased, specific.
5
The human core is real
You are not building a scheduling tool. You are building the thing that keeps a 19-year-old with ADHD from losing their financial aid because they couldn't find a PDF.
"The form was always there. We just needed to make it findable."
